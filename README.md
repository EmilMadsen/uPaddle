Code for the Garmin Connect IQ uPaddle  app. :)

Officially available at the Garmin app store: https://apps.garmin.com/da-DK/apps/cff41f71-ab9e-4d43-a0b6-4638079c3d66

This app was developed some years ago as a hobby project, while I was owning a Garmin Vivoactive with limited support for kayak activity tracking. As my current spare time for app development is quite limited, and the app functions within my own requirements, I don't plan on creating any major updates, but feel free to create and commit new functionality! 

Go ahead, should you feel like making use of the code for your own project, but please remember to add a comment to let people known where it came from. Also, send me a link to let me know of all the great projects, that it may be used for!
